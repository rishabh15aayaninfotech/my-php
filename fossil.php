                <p class="normal-text">
                  Even a cursory glance at Birbal Sahni's work on fossil plants inevitably conveys a vivid impression of
                  its extraordinary compass and variety. His researches, in fact, ranged over practically the whole
                  field of palaeobotany. He not only selected the concrete objects of his investigations from all major
                  groups of vascular plants and from nearly all plant-bearing geological systems; but in dealing with
                  this diverse material, and in his more general discussions, he approached the problems involved from
                  every possible angle. Thus his work on fossil plants resulted in contributions to, all pertinent
                  branches of botany, as well as to stratigraphy, palaeogeography and other related lines of geological
                  research. One has the impression that he felt on quite familiar ground whether he was studying
                  intricate anatomical structures, analyzing taxonomic relationships, describing fossil floras, or
                  discussing their bearings on problems of climatic changes or supposed displacements of continents. The
                  reasons for the comprehensive character of Sahni's work may not be evident to botanists insufficiently
                  acquainted with the study of fossil plants and may, therefore, warrant an attempt at analysis.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">It is by no means unusual in fossil botany to find that the publications of one
                  author deal with many matters that are little related except that they concern plants of the past. The
                  palaeobotanist is rarely free to choose his subjects solely with a view to pursuing connected
                  inquiries into certain problems. As a rule he is dependent on the material at his disposal; indeed,
                  most work on fossil plants has been occasioned by access to this or that collection. Fossil plants are
                  scarce, the material is precious and its examination may not infrequently appear to be a duty. It is
                  in fact a characteristic feature of the history of palaeobotany that even the most important advances
                  have often been made by studying and describing accidentally discovered or acquired material. Kidston
                  and Lang, for instance, did not set out to inquire into problems of general morphology. Their primary
                  task was to examine, analyses and describe the structures of the petrified plant- remains from the
                  Devonian of Rhynie; but their work, nevertheless, profoundly influenced our conception of certain
                  fundamental problems connected with the morphology of vascular plants. No doubt the claims of the
                  material often had a particular significance in Sahni's case. His country is rich in fossil plants,
                  and important un described collections as well as imperfectly explored plant-bearing deposits awaited
                  his attention when, at first quite alone, he began work in this vast field. No doubt he was often
                  inspired by a sense of duty not only to botanical science but also to the needs of Indian geology.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">At the same time Sahni's researches largely group themselves along certain lines
                  of connected study, which he evidently chose in preference to others because of their bearings on
                  questions of general importance. A very considerable part of his work was also concerned with the
                  analysis and survey of problems which could be studied without direct reference to concrete material.
                  On the whole it would appear that the diversity of his researches was largely an expression of the
                  wide range of his interests, his extensive knowledge and intellectual versatility. Some of the
                  characteristic features of his many- sided scientific personality became apparent at a remarkably
                  early stage of his career as a research worker.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">There can scarcely be any doubt that Sahni was first attracted to palaeobotany
                  through the influence of the late Professor Sir A. C. Seward, his teacher at Cambridge. After
                  graduating in 1914, he began research at the Botany School where, under Seward's leadership, studies
                  of living and extinct plants were combined to an extent at that time unparalleled elsewhere. At first
                  Sahni engaged in morphological and anatomical investigations of recent plants, chiefly pteridophytes
                  and conifers. Before long he also took up palaeobotanical work, while continuing his studies of living
                  plants. For the remainder of his stay at Cambridge, till he returned to India in 1919, he divided his
                  time between these branches of research, doing a surprising amount of excellent work in both.</p>

                <p class="normal-text">
                  Sahni's work on living plants will be reviewed separately by Dr. P. Maheshwari. But certain
                  palaeobotanical aspects of his early studies cannot be altogether passed over here. One of the
                  questions dealt with in the theoretical part of his publication on Acmopyle (1920a) was concerned with
                  a palaeobotanical matter: the relation of the Cordaitales to the pteridosperms and the conifers. Sahni
                  did not at that time definitely reject the prevailing idea that the Cordaitales were derived from the
                  pteridosperm stock; but he advanced strong arguments against this view and his criticism was later
                  shown to be justified by Florin's comprehensive studies. Sahni's views on various questions relating
                  to the conifers, too, were more in accord with our present knowledge of the oldest fossil conifers
                  than were those of most contemporary authors. In discussing the important problem of the position of
                  the seed in the gymnosperms, he introduced a conception of great general interest from a
                  rialaeobotanical point of view. On the basis of one single but important morphological feature he
                  suggested a division of the gymnosperms into two groups: â€œPhyllosperms", with leaf-borne seeds, and
                  â€œStachyosperms" in which the seed is seated directly on a normal or modified axis. This distinction -
                  accepted in a morphological sense rather than for practical use in taxonomic classification -is
                  reflected in the views of later workers in phyletic morphology (e.g. Zimmermann, Florin). It has even
                  been extended to apply to the position of all sporangia in vascular plants (" Phyllospory" and
                  â€œStachyospory" of H. J. Lam).</p>
                <p class="normal-text">Sahni's views on the phylogeny of the stachyosperms were decidedly advanced. He
                  pointed out the strong evidence against a derivation of these plants from megaphyllous ancestors, and
                  was inclined to regard the position of their megasporangia on caulinar branches as a primitive
                  feature. D. H. Scott expressed similar thoughts at about the same time; but it was not until ten years
                  later that W. Zimmermann introduced the telome concept in his Phylogenie der Pflanzen, and more than
                  another ten years were to pass before direct evidence was brought forward by Florin in the case of the
                  conifers and the Cordaitales. It would be interesting to know whether Sahni - like Zimmermann at a
                  later date was influenced by Kidston and Lang's discovery of the axial and terminal position of the
                  sporangia of the Psilophytales. He did not quote the first Rhynie paper, which had appeared about two
                  years earlier, but this may be due to a natural reluctance to enter into comparisons with plants so
                  remote in systematic position and geological age. Only three years later he showed that he was fully
                  alive to the consequences of the Scottish discoveries by his study of the sporangiophores of the
                  Psilotaceae (1923, 1923 b ).</p>
                <p class="normal-text">n his early work on living plants Sahni followed the example of his teacher by
                  mostly choosing those groups which particularly invite comparison with the fossils. It was almost
                  inevitable that from the first he came to adopt a phyletic view in his morphological interpretations
                  and thus to stand out as a decided adherent of what has been named "the new morphology" (H. HAMSHAW
                  THOMAS, 1931). His discussions of phylogenetic relationships at this time throw a vivid light on his
                  analytical mind and his interest in general problems. But they also show that at an early date he had
                  acquired a remarkably extensive knowledge of the morphology and anatomy of both living and fossil
                  pteriodophytes and gymnosperms. One cannot but be impressed with the large amount of high class work
                  which he crammed into the years he spent at Cambridge, dividing his time, as he did, between various
                  little related and most difficult subjects.
                  Sahni's first contributions to pure palaebotany, too, were products of his research work at the Botany
                  School. With an interval of only a couple of years between them he published papers on two widely
                  different groups of palaeobotanical subjects: <br>
                <ul>
                  <li style="list-style:disc;">The anatomy and morphology of Palaeozoic ferns, and</li>
                  <li style="list-style:disc;">The fossil Plants of the Indian Gondwana formations.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text">His later publications, too, are largely concerned with these two fields of
                  investigation. It was fortunate for palaeobotany, no less than for Sahni himself, that, at the very
                  outset of his scientific career, his attentIon was thus attracted to fruitful branches of research
                  which were to hold his interest to the end of his life. We have Sahni's own words to prove that this
                  important first choice of subjects was chiefly inspired by Seward. Even after Sahni had left England,
                  Seward continued to take a great interest in his gifted Indian pupil who, in after years, frequently
                  expressed his gratitude to the founder and leader of the Cambridge school of palaeobotanical research.
