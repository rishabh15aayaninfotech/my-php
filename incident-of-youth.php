                  There was one incident which shows how early Birbal acquired his curiosity for the unknown and love of
                  adventure. In 1905 the entire family moved to Murree for the summer. One fine morning he collected a
                  few handkerchiefs and one or two small empty tins and asked his elder sister and brother to accompany
                  him. Little did they realize what they were in for. They left home quietly, without a soul knowing,
                  and descended into the ravine on the north side of the town. They descended further and further till
                  they reached the stream. The downward journey did not seem too difficult though occasions were
                  numerous when Birbal had to help them across ditches and boulders. In the excitement of the chase all
                  count of time was lost, except when the pangs of hunger made things unbearable. And when they started
                  on the return journey, it was already nearing dark.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p class="normal-text">
                  It became more and more difficult to climb and Birbal was faced with the task of first helping one and
                  then the other over the huge boulders which even today appear as mountains in retrospect. Night had
                  already fallen and meanwhile the entire household was in a state of turmoil. The servants had been
                  sent out with lanterns to look for the young explorers, little knowing where to find them, since no
                  one imagined for a moment that they could have gone beyond the environs of the town. They reached home
                  late at night tired, hungry and with bleeding feet, not to speak of the unrestrained stream of tears
                  rolling down our cheeks, with the best prospect of receiving, in addition, a good talking to, to say
                  the least. But young Birbal was quite composed, and when father asked him what he meant by leaving
                  home without permission and taking the youngsters, too, with him, he merely answered that he wanted to
                  collect crabs. This unusual reason almost spelt tragedy though ultimately it also proved their saving.
                  â€œCrabs, indeed!" was father's first outburst and with it he took a step forward. For a moment
                  everybody thought all was over and their backs began to itch with a queer feeling of expectancy! But
                  such was his own love of adventure and for search after things new, that he immediately checked
                  himself and said nothing more. Birbal accompanied his father on many excursions much more difficult
                  and dangerous. The most notable and exciting of these was crossing of the Machoi glacier not far from
                  the Zoji la Pass in 1911, with little more equipment than rope-made chappals for footwear and a local
                  guide. It was here that looking down, he saw in a gaping chasm a horse standing upright, frozen and
                  preserved in its icy grave. As he bent down to peep into the dark, awe-inspiring fissure, it gave him
                  a shudder and a premonition of consequences, unprepared as he was for such an adventure. It was here
                  that Birbal found and collected red snow (a rare snow alga) during the summer of 1911, just before his
                  departure for England. A part of the sample collected was examined by Prof. Seward and is perhaps
                  still preserved at the Botany School, Cambridge. This was a good introduction for the young botanist
                  at Cambridge, for this alga had not been found for a long time past in India.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">Besides his spirit of adventure he had in him a liberal measure of mischief in
                  his early days. Once family stayed at Simla in the house which adjoins the Brahmo Samaj and which they
                  shared with another family. In the small plot that lay between their residence and the Samaj building
                  we had jointly reared vegetable garden. Somehow holiday was cut short, and family had to leave the
                  cool heights of Simla - and of course with it the cucumbers and the half-ripened maize cobs as well.
                  This was too much of a blow, and Birbal conceived the plan to remove all the edible fruit. As if that
                  were not enough, the night prior to our departure, he cut off, under his leadership, the roots of the
                  plants just below the stems with a large pair of scissors. After family left, the plants naturally
                  began to wither slowly, steadily, mysteriously. Was it a fell disease, his erstwhile neighbors
                  thought? They had watered the plants hard enough. Indeed the more they had been watered, the faster
                  they had withered. But neighbors never knew of the secret till they returned to Lahore! and well
                  remember it even now.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">In later years the bent for mischief took turn for playfulness. Many will
                  remember his favorite toy monkey which toured with him over many continents and with which he often
                  used to amuse children. This monkey was bought in Munich from a pavement vendor. Birbal had seen some
                  children playing with a similar monkey and was himself much amused at it. After ransacking many shops
                  he was able to purchase an exact replica and often went to the garden where he had erstwhile seen the
                  children at play to 'perform' during the lunch interval to the great pleasure of the little ones.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">Birbal was of a rather sensitive nature. He formed deep attachments from his
                  early days, which may be illustrated by an incident during his college career. when the results of the
                  Intermediate examination, at which one of his close and inseparable friends had appeared, were
                  announced. By an inexplicable stroke of misfortune his class fellow was declared unsuccessful. This
                  created not only storm in the house, but almost spelt tragedy, because for at least two days Birbal
                  wept like a child and refused to eat. For a number of days his movements caused anxiety, and it was
                  only very gradually that he reconciled himself to the idea that a friend of his was left one year
                  behind him at college.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">Most outstanding was his desire for equity and fair-play. Partly by virtue of
                  being the eldest brother at Lahore (the eldest was then in England) and partly because of his
                  affectionate temperament, the younger brothers and sisters recognized him as an impartial arbitrator
                  in the family. Whether it was a dispute about the ownership of a pencil or a book, or as to who should
                  last switch off the light in the cold winter nights, we all looked to him for a decision, and what is
                  more important, everybody abided by it.</p>

                <p class="normal-text">
                  Birbal's interests were wide and his discovery of the coin moulds at Rohtak in March 1936 bears
                  witness. This archaeological discovery by a palaeobotanist, with the stroke of a geologist's hammer,
                  symbolizes the vitality and versatility of the man. It is a tribute to his genius that not only did he
                  make this unique discovery, but also threw himself heart and soul into the study of these coin moulds.
                  He published his results in a masterly monograph in the journal of the Numismatic Society in 1945,
                  setting, according to a numismatist, a new standard of research in the subject. For this purpose he
                  set himself to the study of some of the Indian coin moulds as well as those from China. He took keen
                  interest in all geological problems, even those that had no direct bearing upon his palaeobotanical
                  work. But it must be said that, if one scratched him deep enough, one always found a botanist in the
                  core.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">Apart from his scientific interests, he was much inclined towards music and he
                  could play on the sitar and the violin. He was also interested in drawing and clay-modeling and he
                  utilized opportunities, whenever he was free from his other work, to visit the Arts School, Luc know,
                  for further acquaintance with these arts.</p>

              <h3>Independent Outlook</h3>
              <div class="divider"></div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p class="normal-text">
                  There was another aspect of Birbal's attitude towards life which comes forcibly to mind and which
                  shows his independent outlook and his love for the science to which he remained devoted throughout
                  life, and in which he was subsequently to make a name for himself and for his country. Father was one
                  of those disciplinarians from whom a mere suggestion was usually enough to settle where the decision
                  lay. He and his friends had sometimes discussed what career the sons were to follow. In the summer of
                  1911 came Birbal's turn to proceed to England for higher studies. Birbal was asked to prepare for his
                  departure. There could not be much argument about it, but I distinctly remember Birbal's answer: that
                  if it was an order, he would go, but that if his own inclinations in the matter were to be considered,
                  he would take up a research career in Botany, and nothing else. Though this astonished father for a
                  while, yet he consented, for in spite of his strong disciplinarian attitude, he gave perfect freedom
                  of choice in essential matters. Thus it was that Birbal took up a career as a botanist. In this case,
                  perhaps, father's acquiescence was not so difficult, as he had been himself always keen on research
                  and, indeed, after years of service as a professor of chemistry, he went to Manchester where he
                  carried out investigations on radioactivity with Prof. Ernest Rutherford, results of which were
                  subsequently published. Indeed, Birbal helped him there in photographic and other incidental work
                  during the vacations, though he had himself to take the Natural Science Tripos, Part II, in the same
                  year. It scarcely needs repetition that father's example gave the incentive and inspiration for
                  research to all those around him, and not only that; he inculcated a spirit of fearless, shedding the
                  lustre of freedom around himself which played its own part in the independence movement.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">Although Birbal gained many academic distinctions but he did not plan to seek
                  them. He invariably had an independent outlook where such matters were concerned, irrespective of
                  consequences. Once during his B.Sc. examination of the Punjab University sitting down the Botany
                  examination he found that question paper set was an exact, or almost exact, replica of the paper set
                  at a previous examination. He thought that such a question paper might give undue advantage to some
                  and an undue handicap others, and that, in any case, it could not be a fair test of knowledge. He got
                  up, handing the (blank) answer sheets to the invigilator against all persuasion, walked out of the
                  hall in protest. When came home within less than half an hour of the commencement of the examination
                  and met father at the doorstep, it was a worthy sight! The surprised parent could not decide whether
                  to show anger or laugh at situation, such as even he as a professor of long standing had never been
                  faced with â€“ a situation comic enough, but, nevertheless, potentially fraught with serious
                  consequences for the University was in no way bound to set a fresh paper to please the impetuosity of
                  a young student. The matter went to the University Syndicate. Birbal one the day, for it was decided
                  that no examiner could be so easy going or disinterested as to pick up an earlier paper and inflict it
                  upon the students, almost to to. A fresh paper was set for him. This shows how well he held the
                  courage of convictions, where even an older man might have been afraid to lose a year so
                  unnecessarily, being well able to answer the questions set.</p>
